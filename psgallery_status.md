PowerShell Gallery Status
=========================
### 06/03/2021 02:28 UTC The [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com) was unavailable via HTTPS.

__Status: Resolved__

__Summary of Impact__: Users were unable to access the gallery or download packages using HTTPS.  

__Root Cause__: The SSL certificate expired after the 3 months and the renewed certificate thumbprint was not updated after renewal. The renewal for these certificates was set to 80% of the lifespan of the certificate. Because the validity period is now only 3 months, it was renewed only about 8 days before the old cert became invalid. Thumbprint values have a Key Vault secret reference in the repository and this value gets retrieved and updated in the cloud service configuration file whenever a new cloud service is deployed. We have now changed the validity of the certificate to expire every one year, but will be renewed every three months. This gives us more time to update the configuration on the cloud service and will reduce the chances of any downtime. We are still working on automating the process to avoid any re-deployment.

### 03/22/2020 02:30 UTC The [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com) was unable via HTTPS.

__Status: Resolved__

__Summary of Impact__: Users were unable to access the gallery or download packages using HTTPS.  

__Root Cause__: In the last few months we addressed some internal compliance mandates to autorotate our certificates every 3 months. The renewal for these certs was set to 80% of the lifespan of the cert. Because our certificates were valid for a year this meant we had nealry 3 months to do a deployment in order to update the thumbprint to reference the new certificate (a timeframe in which our deployment cadence fell within). Because the validity period is now only 3 months, it was renewed only about 8 days before the old cert became invalid.  Thumbprint values have a Key Vault secret reference in the repository and this value gets retrieved and updated in the cloud service configuration file whenever a new cloud service is deployed. We are in the process of automating this process so that a deployment is not necessary to update a cert's thumbprint and thumbprints are updated upon cert renewal.




### 10/30/2020 18:15 UTC The [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com) is currently:  __Experiencing a continued outage

__Status: Resolved__

__Summary of Impact__: PowerShellGallery.com is experiencing an outage.  Users will be unable to access the gallery or download packages.  

__Root Cause__: Work was happening to migrate data lost from the last outage to get the statistics up-to-date.  However, an update to the database caused extremely high CPU/DTU utilization which tied up cloud service resources.  In an effort to mitigate this issue the production database was restored to a point in time where the database was in a stable state, however this restore caused an error in the configuration of the SQL cluster that resulted in the gallery front end not able to authenticate with the SQL backend.  Unfortunately, it took awhile to figure this out. Once that was identified, the SQL configuration was fixed and validated that basic operations are working again.  This means for now the statistics are not complete and we'll look at fixing that later after reviewing how this mistake occurred.  We are actively monitoring the gallery to ensure it maintains proper operation across all regions.


### 10/15/2020 - PowerShellGallery.com may temporarily experience latency and/or low availability 

Database updates will be made on Monday, October 19th at 9am and will last 10 minutes.  The update will lock specific tables in the database and may potentially impact search requests made to the gallery.  This should not impact package downloads. 

### 10/7/2020 - PowerShellGallery.com is experiencing low availability that may result in an inability to install package or access data on the website.

__Status: Resolved__

__Summary of Impact__: PowerShellGallery.com is experiencing lags and low availability.  Further updates will be made pending mitigation and resolution.  

__Root Cause__: Under investigation

### 6/11/2019 - PowerShellGallery.com is not responding

__Status: Resolved__

__Summary of Impact__: PowerShellGallery.com was unavailable between 8:15 AM and 11:15 AM Pacific Time. 

__Root Cause__: This occurred because of a routine configuration update the previous day: we updated a password used for sending email. The new password contained a character which was not valid as part of a URL, but the script used to perform the update did not correctly escape the character. This meant that each service instance as it restarted would read the new configuration and fail to load. This would have been caught in the test gallery, but the script also silently failed to restart the service instances, so nothing went wrong immediately and the configuration change was applied to the production gallery as well. As each service instance restarted afterwards, it entered a failed state. At the start of the incident, the last instances restarted and the service became unavailable.

__Resolution__: Changes have been made to the script and process used to roll out configuration changes to prevent this problem from recurring, and the service itself has also been made more robust against this kind of issue. 

### 10/24/2018 - Some downloads failing with 'End of Central Directory Record Could not be found'

__Status: Resolved__

__Summary of Impact__: Users in some regions reported issues downloading some packages. The downloads reported an error similar to: "Install-Package : Package 'AzureRM.profile' failed to be installed because: End of Central Directory record could not be found.".

This was due to an error in CDN configuration which lead to an invalid file being cached and served by some CDN regions. The issue is now believed resolved, please contact cgadmin@microsoft.com if you still see this problem.



### 9/13/2018 - Link to Facebook not working

__Status: Resolved__

__Summary of Impact__: The link from the package details pages to Facebook is not currently working. Root cause is being investigated. As a temporary workaround, users need to manually create entries in Facebook that link to their PowerShell Gallery items.

__Root Cause__: Related to update to newer gallery version

__Resolution__: Due to historical low usage, all the social media buttons (FaceBook, Twitter and LinkedIn) have been removed from the site.

__Next Steps__: 

### 9/13/2018 - Azure Automation integration was not working

__Status: Resolved__

__Summary of Impact__: The interaction between Azure Automation and PowerShell Gallery was broken temporarily. The links to the PowerShell Gallery from inside Azure Automation were not functioning. 

__Root Cause__: A configuration change was applied to Azure Automation that corrected the issue.

__Resolution__: Changes to data structures in the new PowerShell Gallery resulted in the Automation Gallery not being able to interpret the data. 

__Next Steps__: A configuration change has been applied, the issue is resolved to the best of our knowledge. 


## History of previous issues

### 10/10/2017 - PowerShell Gallery unavailable for 2 hours 10/10/17

__Status: RESOLVED__

__Summary of Impact__: The PowerShell Gallery experienced a period of very high latency, resulting in intermittent connection issues, beginning approximately 5pm (PDT) 10/10/17. While resolving the issue, the site was taken offline for 2 hours starting approximately 10pm (PDT). The site was restored shortly before midnight 10/10/2017. 
 
__Root Cause__: 

__Resolution__: The web services had to be taken offline and restored in order to address the primary issue. 

__Next Steps__: 

### 06/01/2017 - Deploy to Azure Automation Currently Unavailable

__Status: RESOLVED__

__Summary of Impact__: Deploying items with dependencies to Azure Automation from the PowerShell Gallery is currently unavailable.  Importing items from the PowerShell Gallery from inside Azure Automation is still available.  
 
__Root Cause__: Items that have dependencies on others, and have been previously deployed to Azure Automation, will not be deployed to Azure Automation. Engineers have identified an issue with how ARM templates are generated for items with dependencies for the Deploy to Azure Automation functionality.

__Resolution__: Engineers are working to resolve issue.  The current workaround for users is to import the item from the PowerShell Gallery from inside Azure Automation. 

__Next Steps__: Engineers will release the fix shortly.  In the meantime, please use the recommended workaround. 


### 04/11/2017 - Users unable to log in with Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts

__Status: RESOLVED__

__Summary of Impact__: Some users were unable to log in to the PowerShell Gallery using Azure AD Accounts. 
 
__Root Cause__: During an update to interact more securely with AAD, a setting change was missed. 
The testing done to validate the change did not include certain types of AAD accounts, so the deployment proceeded.

__Resolution__: Engineers identified the missing setting and corrected the problem. 

__Next Steps__: We will be modifying our testing to include a broader set of AAD account types.

### 03/27/2017 - RESOLVED: Unable to see individual module and script pages

__Status: RESOLVED__
